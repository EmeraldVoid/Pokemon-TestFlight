      <h2>About TestFlight</h2>
      <p>Your dream Pokémon adventure is about to begin! With a pair of running shoes, some spending money (thanks, Mom!), and excitement in your heart, you're ready to take on the world.</p>

<p>After receiving your first Pokémon from the esteemed Professor <strong>[NAME]</strong>, you learn about an ambitious new venture—<strong>Battle Tower</strong>, a colossal skyscraper rising from the mysterious <em>League Island</em>. Developed by the powerful conglomerate <strong>Big Poke Co.</strong>, Battle Tower replaces the traditional Gym system. Instead of traveling town to town, trainers now climb the tower, facing all <strong>eight Gym Leaders</strong>, the <strong>Elite Four</strong>, and finally the <strong>Champion</strong>, all under one roof. Is it about saving space? Maximizing profits? Or creating the ultimate training gauntlet? The truth is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Professor [NAME] has been personally invited to visit League Island by Big Poke Co.’s enigmatic CEO. Seeing potential in you, the professor extends an invitation for you to join him and take on the Battle Tower challenge yourself.</p>

<p>Your goal is clear: conquer the tower, defeat every Gym Leader, outlast the Elite Four, and claim victory over the Champion. What secrets lie at the top of the tower? Only the strongest will find out.</p>

<p><strong>Adventure, mystery, and glory await—are you ready to climb?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Number of Pokemon:</strong> Over 9,000</p>
      <p><strong>Thing:</strong></p>
