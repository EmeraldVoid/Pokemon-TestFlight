### Game Development: Small Wins, Big Picture

Since posting **State of the Game** #6 , significant progress has been made—especially on the database side.

I’ve added three new Pokémon, including a new Fakemon Grass starter with all its evolutions, moves, and essential game data.

I also have all the necessary information for the Water and Fire starters (see Issue [#24](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/issues/24)). The next step is to integrate this data and the associated graphics into the database and thoroughly test everything. While adding the data is time-consuming, the results so far have been rewarding.

Additionally, I’ve begun working on the intro cutscene (see Issue [#29](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/issues/29)).

That’s about where things stand for now. I have a rough roadmap toward the version 0.1 release, but progress is slower than expected due to work and real-life commitments.
