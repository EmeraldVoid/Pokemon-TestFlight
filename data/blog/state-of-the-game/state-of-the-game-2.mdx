### Development Update: Building a Testbed for Creativity

Lately, I've been diving deep into both RPG Maker XP and PSDK, setting up a flexible testing environment to help speed up iteration. This includes scripting item and Pokémon giveaways, setting up battle tests, and expanding the Pokédex to accommodate non-native entries. Here's a look at what I've been working on:

---

A simple, repeatable battle setup—perfect for testing different Pokémon, AI behaviors, and team configurations.

Meet **Kimono Girl Suzu**, one of my core testing NPCs. Her team is easily adjustable for testing different level ranges, AI difficulty, and move variety.

Suzu is joined by **Carlos**, a utility NPC who hands out items and Pokémon. He's great for testing give-item and give-Pokémon commands, as well as verifying sound and timing.

Here, Carlos gives the player **99 Awakenings**, and two level 100 Pokémon: **Incineroar** and **Corviknight**. Adding Corviknight required expanding the dex, which was a great chance to test data management, move creation, and ability assignments.

---

This testbed environment will be a huge help as the project evolves, letting me quickly prototype ideas, balance teams, and squash bugs more efficiently.
