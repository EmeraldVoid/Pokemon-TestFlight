### Development Update: Exploring New Tools for the Project

I wanted to share a quick update on the current progress and use this as a development log entry. Right now, I’m at a crucial decision point, evaluating the best tools for the project.

I’ve been experimenting with both PSDK and Essentials 21.1 for TestFlight, each offering unique advantages and challenges. There’s a lot of research going into understanding how each fits with my vision for the game, and I’m weighing the pros and cons carefully.

One of the advantages of having a flexible storyline for a project like this is that it gives me the freedom to explore and understand the ins and outs of the software. It also helps me figure out the best direction for the project moving forward. After all, this is a learning experience as much as it is a creative endeavor.

I’ll be diving deeper into both options and will share more insights as I continue testing. **Stay tuned for more updates soon!**
