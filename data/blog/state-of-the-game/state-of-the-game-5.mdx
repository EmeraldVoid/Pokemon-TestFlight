### Game Development: **Sketching the World, Tile by Tile**

Lately, I've been experimenting with map creation using **Tiled**, an alternative to RPG Maker XP's built-in editor. One of the key advantages of **PSDK** over Essentials is its flexibility—you're free to build maps in Tiled or stick with the classic RPG Maker approach.

I've been watching mapping tutorials and creating test layouts while exploring different design styles. Tiled’s support for layers allows for greater creativity by making it easy to mix and match tilesets. This gives me the freedom to build more dynamic and visually interesting maps.

As I continue to experiment with Tiled, I’ll be sharing screenshots and updates on my progress.

### Update:

Here is a map I have been experimenting with, It's some sort of Battle/Challenge room? I'm not really sure, it's just a test map so it may not even make it into the final game.
