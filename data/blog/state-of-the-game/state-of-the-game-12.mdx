Got a lot to cover in the post so let's dive in:

In [State of the Game #4](https://pokemon-test-flight.vercel.app/blog/state-of-the-game/state-of-the-game-4) I had mentioned Executive Thorn's team and a bit of lore behind him.

Due to the nature of game development and story telling, a lot of this info has changed and can potentially keep on chaning as the gaem gets farther along in production.
