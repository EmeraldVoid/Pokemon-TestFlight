Work and life have been getting the best of me lately, and I haven’t worked on this as much as I’d like to. **BUT**—there has been some small progress (and hey, small progress is better than no progress at all). We’ve got quite a bit to go over in this post, so let’s dive in.

# Thorn

In [State of the Game #4](https://pokemon-test-flight.vercel.app/blog/state-of-the-game/state-of-the-game-4), I mentioned Executive Thorn’s team and shared a bit of the lore behind him.

As with most things in game development and storytelling, some of that information has shifted—and will likely continue to evolve as the game progresses. For now, his team is staying the same for testing purposes. That said, don’t expect it to remain that way in the final release.

This issue is:

# Unnamed Gym Leader 1

I’ve made some decent headway with the first unnamed Gym Leader. I have their name, a partial team put together, a short piece of dialogue written, and a small blurb that fleshes out their character. What still needs doing: completing the full team, finalizing their dialogue, and actually building the gym.

# Unnamed Gym Leader 2

There’s less progress here. I’ve got a name and a general idea for their team, but nothing written down yet—just rough notes. I still need to do pretty much everything else, from team composition to dialogue to gym design.

# Intro Cutscene

No progress made here yet. Life and work have kept this on the back burner, and frankly, it’s a lower priority at the moment.

# Fakémon

The Fakémon are all done! All of their evolutions, move animations, and other mechanics are complete—what’s left now is just testing them in-game.

# Trainers Batch 001

Still untouched. No progress made yet.
