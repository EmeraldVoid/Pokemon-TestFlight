### Game Development: Pauses and Priorities

Welcome back to State of the Game! This week’s update is a bit lighter than usual — life’s been busy, and development has taken a short pause.

Between work obligations and personal commitments, I haven’t had much time to make progress on the v0.01a Alpha Build. That said, I’m not too concerned about falling behind — there’s no hard deadline yet, and I’m still on track overall.

The plan is to carve out some dedicated dev time this weekend and hopefully get things rolling again. As always, I’ll share any major updates as soon as they’re ready.

Thanks for sticking around, and stay tuned for more soon!
