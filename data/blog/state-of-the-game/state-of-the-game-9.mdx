### Game Development: **Building Blocks and Breakthroughs**

Progress on **TestFlight** has picked up significantly, with several key pieces falling into place.



## Gym Leader Map

**Issue** #27 – **Open**

No major updates here yet. My attention has been elsewhere in development, and I’m still brainstorming the best layout for the tower. It’s on hold for now while I do more planning and research, but it’s on the radar.



### Gym Leaders 1 & 2

**Issue** #12 & #13 – **Open**

I’ve selected 8 sprite candidates for my Gym Leaders and paired each with a custom badge. Names and types are all locked in! Still fine-tuning the overall design and placement, but it's shaping up really well.



### Title Screen Update

**Issue** #25 – **Closed**

TestFlight now has a placeholder title screen for the `v0.1a Alpha Build` — a small but exciting step.

### Fakémon Starters

**Issue** #24 – **Open**

All three starters are now added to the database! The next step is moving into the `testing phase` to refine their stats, movesets, and balance.



All in all, solid strides toward a playable demo. Still a long way to go, but the process is feeling more rewarding with each step.
