## A Glimpse Into the Story

I know I just released **[State of the Game #8](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/discussions/36)**, but there’s a bit more I’ve been brewing creatively for *Pokémon TestFlight*. I wanted to share a teaser — something narrative-driven to help frame the world we’re building. This is version one of the professor’s introductory speech, reimagined as a cinematic short story and narrative hook. Think of it as both a story draft and a bit of in-world “advertising.” Hope you enjoy it.

_The screen fades in from black._

A tower — impossibly tall, its spire lost in the clouds — dominates the horizon. Steel and glass gleam in the morning light as gulls circle the upper floors, crying into the wind. At its base, amidst polished stone and a whirring drone camera, a lone figure waits.

A professor, dignified yet approachable, smiles at the camera.

> “Hello there, young trainer. Welcome… to the world of Pokémon.”

They pause, hands resting casually in their coat pockets, as if recalling something fond.

> “I’ve given that speech a thousand times. But today, this isn’t that kind of story.”

The camera slowly pans to the tower behind them — vast, monolithic, alive with digital signage and rising above even the tallest trees nearby.

> “This is Battle Tower. And you, lucky trainer, have been invited to be part of something new.”

The professor’s voice shifts from warm to energized.

> “Executive Thorn, head of the Pokételion Group, has launched an ambitious venture — the *Battle Island League*. No traditional gym circuit. No rival chasing your heels. Just one tower. Eight floors. One ultimate goal.”

As thunder growls in the distance, the view tilts upward, toward the peak of the tower shrouded in mist and mystery.

> “Climb floor by floor. Challenge Gym Leaders. Defeat the Elite Four. And if you’ve still got strength left... face Thorn himself.”

The professor steps closer. Their voice lowers, more personal now.

> “This isn’t a journey across towns. It’s a gauntlet in one place. And every step upward tests your strategy, your resilience, and the strength of your Pokémon bonds.”

A Pokéball glints in their outstretched hand.

> “So. Are you ready to climb?”

White flash. A swell of dramatic music.

**Pokémon TestFlight — Your Ascent Begins Now.**

> **Note:** This is not the final in-game version of the professor's speech — just an early concept and lore teaser. I wanted to play around with tone and presentation while working on some related graphics and ideas. More soon!
