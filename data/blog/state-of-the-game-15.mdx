### Quick Update

I wanted to share a quick update this morning before heading to work.

I've completed the sprites and teams for all the minion trainers you'll encounter before facing the gym leader. However, I still need to finalize their dialogue and balance their monetary rewards. Progress is steadily advancing, with just a few more tasks to finish regarding the gym leaders. After that, I can focus on addressing more of the [open issues](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/issues).
