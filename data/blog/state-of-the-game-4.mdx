### Game Development: Building the Tower, Brick by Brick

Progress has been steady — if a bit slow — as I continue shaping **Pokémon TestFlight** into the tower-focused experience I envision.

### Tilesets & Collision Work

Lately, I've been focused on integrating **new tilesets from Essentials into PSDK**. This process is proving time-consuming, as each tileset requires manual collision mapping after import. It’s a bit of a grind, but piece by piece, the visual foundation of the game is coming together.

### Database Management & Executive Thorn

On the backend, I’ve been doing some **PSDK database work**, including implementing our first major boss:

> **Executive Thorn**, CEO of the Pokételion Group and Champion of Battle Island.

His team, items, and battle logic are now fully in the game.

### About Executive Thorn’s Team

> Executive Thorn’s team is a calculated blend of **defense, attrition, and brutal precision** — much like the corporate empire he built. As the CEO of the Pokételion Group and the architect behind Battle Island, his battle philosophy mirrors his business mindset: **control the board, pressure the opponent, and strike only when the outcome is guaranteed**.

> Thorn leads with **tanks like Corviknight and Blissey** to wear opponents down through pivoting and status effects. His midgame core — **Rotom-Wash, Excadrill, and Garchomp** — is built to punish overextensions and bait misplays. Then there’s his ace: **Mega Metagross**, a cold and calculated closer that hits fast and ends fights before they begin.

> Thorn doesn’t just test your Pokémon — he tests your strategy, patience, and adaptability. **Beating him isn’t just a victory... it’s a promotion.**

### Narrative Polish & Naming Update

In terms of world-building, I’ve rebranded the placeholder company name. **Big Poke Co.** is now officially known as **The Pokételion Group**, to better match the game’s tone and corporate-battle setting.

### Learning Curve & Next Steps

PSDK is proving to have a **steeper learning curve** than I anticipated, so I’ve been diving into forums, tutorials, and documentation to get a better grip on how to do what I want to do.

I’m also working on some **UserBars** for fans who’d like to show support for the project — more on that soon!
