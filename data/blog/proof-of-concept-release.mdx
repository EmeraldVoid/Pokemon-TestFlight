# Demo Release – Proof of Concept Build

The time has finally come! While this isn’t the Alpha Build just yet, it *is* the first playable version of **Pokémon TestFlight**—a Proof of Concept designed to gather early feedback. Whether you're playtesting or just curious, you're welcome to [download and try it out](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/releases)!

## What’s in the Demo?

This demo is intentionally bare-bones, created to test core mechanics and gather impressions. I initially shared it with a few friends for feedback, and now it's available to the public.

### Features:

* **Two Gym Leaders**: Face off against **Stratus** and **Coalton**, including all their minions.
* **Random Starter Teams**:

  * Start with 6 random Level 13 Pokémon and challenge Stratus and his team.
  * Afterward, talk to a nearby NPC to get a new team of Level 17 Pokémon and take on Coalton and the Bedrock Crew.
* **Basic Facilities**: A shop and Pokémon Center are available (currently placeholder NPCs—these will get proper storefronts later).
* **Bonus Boss Fight**: After defeating both Gym Leaders, you can challenge an optional boss fight using [Zøzo’s Pokémon Boss System](https://gitlab.com/Zodiarche/cc-pokemon-boss-system). It’s a fun extra, and I may include more of these battles in the post-game! (More on that in a later post)

This build is running on the PSDK shell with a few light modifications. I'm currently using many of the default maps and assets to focus on learning the engine and building a solid foundation.

## What’s Next?

Here are a few features I’m planning for the next update:

* [ ] Add an [intro cutscene with the Professor](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/issues/29)
* [ ] Rebalance teams as needed
* [ ] Create dedicated gym battle maps
* [ ] Implement [GUI upgrades](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/issues/35)

Thanks for playing and testing—this is just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep building *Pokémon TestFlight* with your help.
