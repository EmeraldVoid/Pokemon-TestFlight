### Development Update: Refining the Vision: From Open World to Tower Challenge

As I’ve been experimenting with both Pokémon Essentials and PSDK, the scope of **Pokémon TestFlight** has shifted—and with it, so has the plot.

## Original Vision: A Proof of Concept for Open Exploration

> *Pokémon TestFlight* is a fangame created by Emerald_Void using Pokémon Essentials and PSDK.  
>  
> Unlike traditional Pokémon games, *TestFlight* emphasizes open-world exploration. In many official titles, exploration can feel a bit restricted—*TestFlight* flips that by letting you roam freely the moment you receive your starter.  
>  
> There's less focus on linear storytelling, and more on player-driven adventures like battling Gym Leaders, challenging the Elite Four, and uncovering endgame content.  
>  
> This game also serves as a proof of concept and learning project, as the developers explore and experiment with Pokémon Essentials and PSDK. It was built to test core mechanics and ideas for future, more expansive projects.

## Updated Direction: The Towering Challenge of Battle Island

> Your dream Pokémon adventure is about to begin! With a pair of running shoes, some spending money (thanks, Mom!), and excitement in your heart, you're ready to take on the world.  
>  
> After receiving your first Pokémon from the esteemed Professor **[NAME]**, you learn about an ambitious new venture—**Battle Tower**, a colossal skyscraper rising from the mysterious *Battle Island*.  
>  
> Developed by the powerful conglomerate **Big Poke Co.**, Battle Tower replaces the traditional Gym system. Instead of traveling town to town, trainers now climb the tower, facing all **eight Gym Leaders**, the **Elite Four**, and finally the **Champion**, all under one roof. Is it about saving space? Maximizing profits? Or creating the ultimate training gauntlet? The truth is anyone's guess.  
>  
> Professor [NAME] has been personally invited to Battle Island by Big Poke Co.’s enigmatic CEO. Seeing potential in you, the professor invites you to join him and take on the Battle Tower challenge.  
>  
> Your goal is clear: conquer the tower, defeat every Gym Leader, outlast the Elite Four, and claim victory over the Champion. What secrets lie at the top of the tower? Only the strongest will find out.  
>  
> **Adventure, mystery, and glory await—are you ready to climb?**

## Notes on the Change

Nothing major has changed in terms of the core experience—the game still features open-world exploration—but it’s now more focused and slightly scaled down. Writing a cohesive, branching plot was more difficult than I anticipated, so this new format helps me keep things manageable while still offering plenty of player freedom.

Instead of journeying from town to town, everything now takes place on **Battle Island**—either out in the open world or within the towering Battle Tower itself.

I'm still deep in the experimentation phase, so there's no concrete playable demo just yet, but progress is being made. Stay tuned—more updates are coming soon!
