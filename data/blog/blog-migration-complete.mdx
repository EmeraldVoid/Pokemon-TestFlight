> This post appears both on the blog and the GitHub Discussions page—no differences between the two.


The migration is officially done — all previous blog posts from GitHub Discussions have been moved right here to their new home on the site.

If this is your first time visiting the blog:  
Hi! I’m **Emerald_Void**, the solo developer behind **Pokémon TestFlight**. Welcome! Feel free to explore — there's plenty of content about the game's development and progress.

Curious about how development is going? Start with the [State of the Game](https://pokemon-test-flight.vercel.app/tags/state-of-the-game) series to get a behind-the-scenes look at what’s being worked on.

Want to go even deeper? Head over to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/issues) on GitHub to see all the active development tasks and plans.

> [!NOTE]
> All features and issues are subject to change as the game evolves.

If you’re reading this on GitHub Discussions, there's now a dedicated blog at [pokemon-test-flight.vercel.app](https://pokemon-test-flight.vercel.app/). This is now the official home for all updates and dev logs. While a few finishing touches (like the logo and category structure) are still being worked on, the blog is essentially complete.

If you’ve been following the project and reading the “State of the Game” posts — thank you so much!  
If you’re new — **welcome aboard!** Feel free to [join the conversation](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/discussions/categories/general), ask questions, or just say hi.

More updates soon!
