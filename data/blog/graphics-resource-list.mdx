Since I won't always be able to update teh blog post when a new version is released, you can check _Cham3leon's [Submitted Posts](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cham3leon/submitted/) and you should find it.

Big shoutout to _Cham3leon and all of the wonderful contributors to the google doc. This is a pretty amazing resource and I wouldn't surprised if it doesn't make it  into some sort of stickied thread on the [r/PokemonRMXP](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonRMXP/) or [r/PokemonROMhacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/)

More upates for TestFlight are coming soon! (probably later tonight)
