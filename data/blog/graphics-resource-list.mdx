So what is the Ultimate Tileset Collection?

> ... "a Google Doc site on which I will be listing all the links to public tilesets, sorted by author and by Outdoor, Indoor, etc..."

I'll do my best to keep this post up to date when new versions are released, but feel free to check _Cham3leon's [Submitted Posts](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cham3leon/submitted/) if you're looking for the latest version.

I'd like to extend a huge thank you to _Cham3leon and the many contributors who have made this resource possible. It's an incredibly valuable asset for anyone working on a Pokémon fangame, and I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually makes its way into a stickied thread on the [r/PokemonRMXP](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonRMXP/) or [r/PokemonROMhacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/) subreddits.

As for TestFlight, expect more updates soon! (hopefully by the end of the night)
