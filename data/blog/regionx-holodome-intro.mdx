### **Dev Log: RegionX HoloDome & Darren Vexel**

I recently opened an [Issue](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/issues/45) to introduce a new NPC: **Darren Vexel**â€”a former PokÃ©star Studios mocap actor turned holo-battle architect.

His purpose? To bring a whole new layer to the battle sim: the ability to challenge **every Gym Leader from every region** through high-tech simulations!

In **Hardcore Mode**, these battles get even tougher:

* Level 100 opponents
* Smarter AI
* Competitive items and full healing
* Cross-generational upgrades (imagine Brock with a Terrakion or Mega Tyranitar ðŸ‘€)

Building these teams has been a creative blastâ€”itâ€™s a fun challenge to reimagine old Gym Leaders with modern strategies and theming. Giving them new life and depth feels like honoring their legacy while raising the stakes.

That said, this wonâ€™t be a quick task. There are **72 Gym Leaders**, each with a **full team of 6 PokÃ©mon**â€”thatâ€™s **432 unique builds** to create, test, and balance. Itâ€™s a big project, but one Iâ€™m excited to chip away at during breaks from core game development.

Thanks for following alongâ€”this feature is shaping up to be one of the most exciting additions to *TestFlight*. Stay tuned!
