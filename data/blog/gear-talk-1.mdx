# Gear Talk: Falling in Love with the Ajazz AK870

![Ajazz AK870 Keyboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcbf56b8-3998-422a-82a8-e80ad40f625b)

Next up on the dev blog ‚Äî something a little personal. It‚Äôs not strictly about game development, but if you‚Äôre working with computers all day (like most devs), it *definitely* matters: **keyboards**.

I‚Äôm a bit of a keyboard nerd. I don‚Äôt eat, sleep, and breathe switches, but I love the hunt ‚Äî especially when it comes to finding the perfect combo of form, function, and feel. Recently, I picked up the **Ajazz AK870**, and let me just say: I‚Äôm absolutely loving it.

## Why the AK870?

My previous board, the **Akko 3060B+**, needed a little TLC and is currently on the bench. That left me needing a solid daily driver, and I stumbled across the Ajazz AK870 via a YouTube recommendation rabbit hole. It checked off more boxes than I expected:

### Feature Rundown

- **Tri-mode connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0, 2.4GHz wireless, and USB-C  
- **Impressive battery life**  
- **Linear switches:** I‚Äôm a huge fan of linear switches. This board uses **Maillard switches**, which feature a unique front housing piece that enhances RGB diffusion. Sounds gimmicky, but the effect is *gorgeous* in person.  
- **Double-shot PBT keycaps**  
- **Layered internal foam and padding** for better sound and feel  
- **Removable volume knob** + customizable 3-key slot  
- **Built-in LCD screen** (More on that in a second)  

---

## Setup & Software

The Ajazz software was a bit of a pain to track down ‚Äî I eventually found it on Epomaker along with the PDF manual. The annoying bit? The software won‚Äôt detect the board unless it‚Äôs directly connected via USB-C.

That said, the included **braided cable** is high quality, so it wasn‚Äôt a total hassle.

---

## The LCD Screen (Why I Love It)

I currently have the screen set to display a simple clock, and honestly, that‚Äôs been a productivity game-changer. I lose track of time constantly when I‚Äôm deep in project work or, let‚Äôs be honest, binging anime or gaming. Having a subtle clock right on the keyboard is a low-key lifesaver.

---

## Build Quality & Feel

This board *feels* amazing. It‚Äôs got some solid weight to it ‚Äî thanks to the internal padding and layers ‚Äî but that‚Äôs a plus in my book. It doesn‚Äôt slide around on the desk and gives a very premium vibe when typing.

Ergonomically, it‚Äôs fantastic. The dual-stage adjustable feet let you choose between two typing angles. I‚Äôve got mine propped all the way up, and it feels just right.

---

## Design & Aesthetics

The color combo is slick:

- **58 white switches**
- **26 black switches**
- **3 mint green switches** on the Esc, Enter, and Spacebar keys

It uses an 87-key **compact TKL layout**, which is a bit bigger than my previous board but still much more compact than a full-size keyboard. It hits the sweet spot between minimalism and function.

## Value for Money

### **Overall Score: 4.78 / 5**

An excellent mechanical keyboard with a premium feel and awesome features. The only real drawback is the clunky software ‚Äî it‚Äôs not intuitive and hard to find. But aside from that, the AK870 is a *top-tier board* in this price range.

## Bonus: Mouse Mini Review

My wife picked up [this wireless mouse](https://www.amazon.com/FFJ-Wireless-Bluetooth-Programmable-Rechargeable/dp/B0F532HLFP/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&sr=1-3) for me on Facebook Marketplace for just **$8** ‚Äî and it pairs surprisingly well with the AK870.

It‚Äôs responsive, has great battery life, and offers decent programmability for the price. I'm really enjoying the combo!

### Final Mouse Score: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
A great budget-friendly addition to the setup.
