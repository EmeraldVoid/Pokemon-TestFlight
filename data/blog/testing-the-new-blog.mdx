# Welcome to the New Blog!

Big news—TestFlight has a new home! In [State of the Game #10](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/discussions/39), I mentioned sticking with GitHub Discussions for updates... but then I discovered the awesome [Tailwind/Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).

After some tinkering (and a lot of trial and error), it’s up and running! The layout’s clean, the stack is solid, and I’m slowly swapping out all the placeholder content as I go.

This is just the beginning, but I’d love your feedback—  

Does the new format work for you?
