# About Pok√©mon TestFlight

**Pok√©mon TestFlight** is a fangame created by **Emerald_Void** using **Pok√©mon Essentials** and **PSDK**.

Unlike traditional Pok√©mon games, TestFlight emphasizes **open-world exploration**. In many official titles, exploration can feel a bit restricted‚ÄîTestFlight flips that by letting you roam freely the moment you receive your starter. There's less focus on linear storytelling, and more on player-driven adventures like battling Gym Leaders, challenging the Elite Four, and uncovering endgame content.

This game also serves as a **proof of concept and learning project**, as the developers explore and experiment with Pok√©mon Essentials and PSDK. It was built to test core mechanics and ideas for future, more expansive projects.
